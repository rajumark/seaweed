If Seaweed grows to:

* **1000+ screens**
* **5000+ ADB actions/commands**

then you should stop thinking in terms of:

* “screen files”
* “buttons”
* “manual menus”

…and start thinking like:

# You are building a PLATFORM

Not just an ImGui app.

At that scale, the architecture changes completely.

---

# What Fails at 1000 Screens

This dies quickly:

```txt
modules/
  battery/
    BatteryScreen.cpp
```

Because eventually:

* too many files
* too many menus
* duplicated UI
* duplicated command execution
* impossible navigation
* impossible search

---

# Best Architecture at Massive Scale

You need 4 layers:

```txt
1. Core Engine
2. Data-Driven Command System
3. Dynamic Screen Registry
4. Reusable UI Blocks
```

---

# REAL Architecture You Want

```txt
seaweed/
├── core/
├── platform/
├── services/
├── modules/
├── commands/
├── schemas/
├── ui/
├── generated/
└── plugins/
```

---

# MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE

# Commands Become DATA

NOT C++ code.

---

# BAD

```cpp
void InstallApkScreen::Render() {
    if(ImGui::Button("Install")) {
        system("adb install app.apk");
    }
}
```

Impossible to scale.

---

# GOOD

```json
{
  "id": "apk.install",
  "title": "Install APK",
  "category": "Applications",
  "command": "adb -s {device} install {apk}",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "file",
      "id": "apk"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now UI becomes generated dynamically.

---

# Why This Changes Everything

Instead of:

```txt
5000 cpp files
```

You get:

```txt
5000 command definitions
```

MUCH easier.

---

# Your UI Should Become:

# "Command Renderer"

NOT individual screens.

---

# Example

The UI engine reads:

```json
{
  "title": "Battery Reset Stats",
  "inputs": [],
  "command": "adb shell dumpsys batterystats --reset"
}
```

Automatically generates:

* page
* form
* execute button
* loading state
* logs
* result output

WITHOUT writing screen code.

---

# Best Structure for Massive Scale

# 1. Command Registry

```txt
commands/
├── battery/
├── packages/
├── files/
├── network/
├── shell/
└── emulator/
```

Example:

```txt
commands/packages/
├── install.json
├── uninstall.json
├── clear-data.json
└── grant-permission.json
```

---

# 2. Dynamic Screen System

Instead of:

```cpp
if(menu == "battery")
```

Use:

```cpp
ScreenRegistry::Register(screen);
```

Then auto-render sidebar.

---

# 3. Reusable UI Blocks

Your app becomes:

* form builder
* table builder
* terminal renderer
* chart renderer

---

# Example Widgets

```txt
ui/widgets/
├── CommandForm
├── DevicePicker
├── LogViewer
├── FilePicker
├── JsonTree
├── PackageTable
├── TerminalOutput
├── ChartView
└── PropertyGrid
```

---

# Then Screens Become Tiny

Instead of 2000-line screens:

```cpp
void BatteryScreen::Render() {
    RenderCommand("battery.reset");
}
```

Done.

---

# VERY IMPORTANT

# Split "ADB Engine" From "UI"

---

# BAD

```txt
BatteryScreen.cpp
```

doing:

* adb execution
* parsing
* state
* UI

---

# GOOD

```txt
ADB Engine
   ↓
Structured Data
   ↓
UI Renderer
```

---

# Example

ADB layer:

```cpp
BatteryInfo GetBatteryInfo(device);
```

Returns:

```cpp
struct BatteryInfo {
    int level;
    int temp;
    bool charging;
};
```

UI only renders data.

# IMPORTANT

At 1000+ screens:

# You NEED search-first navigation

NOT menus only.

---

# Example

VSCode style:

```txt
⌘K → "install apk"
⌘K → "battery stats"
⌘K → "clear cache"
```

Instant open.

This becomes mandatory.

---

# Another Important Thing

# Generate Code

You should eventually have:

```txt
command schema
   ↓
codegen
   ↓
generated bindings
```

---

# Example

From:

```json
{
  "id": "device.reboot"
}
```

Generate:

```cpp
adb.device.reboot();
```

---

# Best Long-Term Design

Seaweed should become:

# "ADB Operating System"

Internally:

* command engine
* task scheduler
* device state manager
* plugin system
* terminal system
* automation system
* scripting support

NOT just:

* buttons calling adb

---

# BEST UI MODEL

At this scale:

## Use:

* Docking
* Tab workspace
* Command palette
* Search everywhere
* Dynamic panels

## Avoid:

* nested menus everywhere
* gigantic sidebars
* fixed navigation trees

---

# Future-Proof Idea

Eventually add:

```txt
automation/
```

User can chain:

```txt
install apk
→ grant permissions
→ clear app data
→ start activity
```

Like workflows.

That becomes MASSIVELY powerful.

---

# Most Important Advice

If you expect:

* 5000 commands
* huge growth

then:

# DO NOT BUILD SCREENS FIRST

Build:

* command engine
* metadata system
* renderer system

FIRST.

That is what makes giant desktop tools scalable.
